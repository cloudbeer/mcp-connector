# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Assistant Chat Interface feature will provide a user-friendly frontend interface for interacting with assistants using the OpenAI-compatible API. This feature will allow users to select an assistant, start a conversation, and receive responses in real-time with streaming support. The interface will leverage the existing backend API endpoints that follow the OpenAI API format.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Assistant Selection and Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select an assistant and chat with it through a user-friendly interface, so that I can easily interact with different assistants without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the chat page THEN the system SHALL display a list of available assistants to choose from.
2. WHEN the user selects an assistant THEN the system SHALL initialize a chat interface for that assistant.
3. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL send the message to the selected assistant using the OpenAI-compatible API.
4. WHEN the assistant responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat interface.
5. WHEN the user switches assistants THEN the system SHALL create a new chat session with the newly selected assistant.

### Requirement 2: Real-time Streaming Responses

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see assistant responses appear in real-time as they are generated, so that I can receive information more quickly and have a more interactive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL request a streaming response from the API.
2. WHEN the API sends chunks of the response THEN the system SHALL update the chat interface in real-time with each chunk.
3. WHEN the streaming response is complete THEN the system SHALL indicate completion in the UI.
4. IF the connection is interrupted during streaming THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.

### Requirement 3: Chat History and Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my chat history to be preserved within a session, so that I can refer back to previous messages and maintain context in the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a new chat THEN the system SHALL create a new session ID.
2. WHEN a user sends messages in a session THEN the system SHALL maintain the conversation history in the UI.
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore the previous session if it exists.
4. WHEN a session exceeds a certain age THEN the system SHALL provide an option to start a new session.

### Requirement 4: Message Input and Formatting

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to format my messages and see formatted responses, so that the conversation is more readable and expressive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types a message THEN the system SHALL provide a comfortable text input area with appropriate sizing.
2. WHEN the assistant responds with formatted text (markdown) THEN the system SHALL render the formatting correctly.
3. WHEN the user sends a long message THEN the system SHALL handle it appropriately without UI issues.
4. WHEN the assistant response contains code blocks THEN the system SHALL display them with syntax highlighting.

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Status Indicators

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be informed about the status of my requests and any errors that occur, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is being sent THEN the system SHALL display a sending indicator.
2. WHEN the assistant is generating a response THEN the system SHALL display a typing indicator.
3. WHEN an error occurs during message sending or receiving THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.
4. WHEN the network connection is lost THEN the system SHALL notify the user and attempt to reconnect.
5. WHEN the API returns an error THEN the system SHALL display the error message in a user-friendly format.
