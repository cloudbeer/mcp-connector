# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chat interface currently has an issue with Chinese input method handling. When users are typing in Chinese using an input method editor (IME), pressing Enter doesn't send the message as expected but instead confirms the current IME composition. This creates a confusing user experience for users typing in Chinese. This feature aims to improve the chat input experience for users of Chinese and other IME-based input methods.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user typing in Chinese, I want the chat input to correctly handle my Enter key presses when using an IME, so that I can efficiently send messages without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in IME composition mode THEN the system SHALL NOT send the message when Enter is pressed
2. WHEN a user presses Enter to confirm an IME composition THEN the system SHALL keep the confirmed text in the input field
3. WHEN a user presses Enter outside of IME composition mode THEN the system SHALL send the message
4. WHEN a user is using Chinese input method THEN the system SHALL provide a clear visual indication of how to send messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent message sending behavior across different input methods and languages, so that I have a seamless experience regardless of my language preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches between different input methods THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent message sending behavior
2. WHEN a user is typing with non-IME input methods THEN the system SHALL send messages with Enter as before
3. IF a user has IME active but is not in composition mode THEN the system SHALL send the message when Enter is pressed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback about how to send messages when using IME input, so that I understand the expected behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is using an IME input method THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip or hint about using Enter to send messages
2. WHEN a user is in IME composition mode THEN the system SHALL visually indicate that Enter will confirm the composition rather than send the message
3. WHEN a user completes IME composition THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that Enter will now send the message
